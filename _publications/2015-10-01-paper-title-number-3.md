excerpt: 'Based on complicated modelling problems of head trauma, a finite element model of the human head has been developed in order to evaluate different types of brain damage. 233 sections Magnetic Resonance Images of the head of a 42 years old man were prepared. The geometric models of Skull, Meninges and brain were extracted. Mechanical properties related to tissues of the skull, meninges and brain membrane are applied. Obtained results from simulation correlated well with experimental results. After ensuring the validity of the model, data acceleration in the head recording from side impact test was applied to the model. The simulation results showed that the rotational acceleration, due to high strain rate in the brain and increased pressure in meninges, is responsible for rupturing arteries and veins. However, linear acceleration alone does not lead to severe damages in the brain. Developing a new computational model for these injuries evaluation including side crash case, have not been considered in previous studies. So, considering this problem in addition to developing an accurate and efficient FEM head model could be supposing the considerable innovation of this study.'
