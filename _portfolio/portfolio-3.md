A frisbee launcher in a robotic platform was designed in Solidworks and fabricated to participate in ROBOCON 2017 held in Japan. The whole robot consists of four main parts: 
1- Omni‑directional moving base 
2- Frisbee launcher system including mechanisms such as ball‑screw, pulley‑belt, and crank slider
3- Arduino-based controller with use of different sensors and modules
4- Autonomous Frisbee launching algorithm to modell the final location of the thrown disk based on control parameters of the launcher with MLP to throw the disks at certain points
