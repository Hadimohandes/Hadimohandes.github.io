As part of my internship in my undergrad, I participated in a really interesting project.
RASA robot was developed at CEDRA lab (Social Robtoics Lab) at Sharif University of Technology. The robot's purpose is to communiocate in sign language with deaf children. 
My participation was to help with design and fabrication of the robot. Also I teleoperated the robot with wearable devices on my arm, hand, and fingers to test it with interacting with deaf children. 
We were also able to mimic the human fingers' movement in the robot by using leap motion and kinect sensor and map the human movement to the robot.
