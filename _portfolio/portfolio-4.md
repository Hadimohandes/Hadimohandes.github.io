RASA robot was developed at CEDRA lab (Social Robtoics Lab) at Sharif University of Technology. The robot's purpose is to communiocate in sign language with deaf children. 
My participation was to teleoperate the robot with wearable devices on my arm. 
Also we were able to mimic the human fingers' movement in the robot by using leap motion and kinect sensor.
