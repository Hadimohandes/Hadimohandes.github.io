Robot-to-human object handover is a complex task that requires accurate perception and planning. Sensor fusion approaches, which integrate data from multiple sensors, have been proposed to improve the accuracy and robustness of the handover process. Our algorithm relies on two complementary sensor modalities: joint torque sensors on the arm and an eye-in-hand RGB-D camera for sensor feedback. While the torque sensor network detects the human receiver's ``intention'' such as: pull, hold, or bump, the vision sensor network detects if the receiver's fingers have wrapped around the object. Networks' outputs are then fused, based on which a decision is made to either release the object or not.
