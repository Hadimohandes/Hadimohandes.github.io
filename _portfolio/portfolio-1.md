Robot-to-human object handover is a complex task that requires accurate perception and planning. Sensor fusion approaches, which integrate data from multiple sensors, have been proposed to improve the accuracy and robustness of the handover process. Vision-based sensor fusion approaches are the most commonly used techniques for robot-to-human object handover. These approaches combine data from RGB cameras, depth sensors, and other sensors to improve object recognition, grasp planning, and motion planning.
