Hi, my name is Behnam Moradi and I am a robotics software developer. I have always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and innovation, and my passion for robotics led me to pursue a career in this field.

With several years of experience in developing software for robotics systems, I have gained a deep understanding of the complexities involved in designing, implementing, and testing robotics algorithms. I am proficient in programming languages such as Python, C++, and Java, and have industry level and professional experience working with ROS (Robot Operating System) and other robotics frameworks.

My experience includes working on a variety of projects, from developing control algorithms to implementing DL-based perception systems for mobile robots. I am constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and skills, and I am always eager to learn about new developments in the field.

In addition to my technical skills, I am a highly collaborative team player, and I thrive in fast-paced, dynamic environments. I am committed to delivering high-quality work and ensuring that my projects are completed on time and to the highest standards.

I am excited about the future of robotics and the potential for these technologies to transform our world. As a robotics software developer, I am passionate about being part of this exciting field and contributing to the development of cutting-edge robotics systems.

Academic Background
=====
As a graduated MSc student of Software Engineering and researcher, I have acquired a strong academic background in computer science, programming, and software development. My undergraduate studies in Control Systems Engineering provided me with a solid foundation in fundamental control systems, standard control layers in robotic systems, actuators, and software/hardware driver principles.

During my undergraduate studies, I gained practical experience in software development through internships and part-time jobs. These experiences enabled me to apply my theoretical knowledge to real-world problems, and to develop proficiency in various programming languages and tools.

After completing my undergraduate degree, I pursued a Master of Science in Software Engineering to deepen my knowledge of robotic software development methodologies, navigation algorithms, DL-based perception systems, and software project management. As part of my Master's program, I engaged in several interships projects with world class robotics company such as Clearpath Robotics/OTTO Motors and Advanced Intelligent Systems Inc that exposed me to cutting-edge research in the field of robotics software engineering.

My research interests lie in the areas of real-time object pose estimation, sensor fusion, local planning algorithms, software design, and software quality assurance. Through my research, I aim to contribute to the development of software systems that are reliable, scalable, and secure, and to promote the adoption of best practices in the industry.

Overall, my academic background, practical experience, and research interests have equipped me with the skills and knowledge needed to excel as a robotic software engineering researcher and professional.
