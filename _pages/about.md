Hi, welcome to my page. 
my name is Hadi Mohandes and I am a robotics software developer. I am currently working as a researcher at RAMP lab at Simon Fraser University. I got my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering from Sharif Univeristy of Technology and my M.Sc. in Engineering Science and Robotics from Simon Fraser University. 

With several years of experience in developing software for robotics systems, I have gained a deep understanding of the complexities involved in designing, implementing, and testing robotics algorithms. I am proficient in programming languages such as Python, C++, and Java, and have industry level and professional experience working with ROS (Robot Operating System) and other robotics frameworks.

My experience includes working on a variety of projects, from developing control algorithms to implementing DL-based perception systems for mobile robots. I am constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and skills, and I am always eager to learn about new developments in the field.



Academic Background
=====
As a graduated MSc student of Software Engineering and researcher, I have acquired a strong academic background in computer science, programming, and software development. My undergraduate studies in Control Systems Engineering provided me with a solid foundation in fundamental control systems, standard control layers in robotic systems, actuators, and software/hardware driver principles.

During my undergraduate studies, I gained practical experience in software development through internships and part-time jobs. These experiences enabled me to apply my theoretical knowledge to real-world problems, and to develop proficiency in various programming languages and tools.

After completing my undergraduate degree, I pursued a Master of Science in Software Engineering to deepen my knowledge of robotic software development methodologies, navigation algorithms, DL-based perception systems, and software project management. As part of my Master's program, I engaged in several interships projects with world class robotics company such as Clearpath Robotics/OTTO Motors and Advanced Intelligent Systems Inc that exposed me to cutting-edge research in the field of robotics software engineering.

My research interests lie in the areas of real-time object pose estimation, sensor fusion, local planning algorithms, software design, and software quality assurance. Through my research, I aim to contribute to the development of software systems that are reliable, scalable, and secure, and to promote the adoption of best practices in the industry.
